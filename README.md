# Library Management System

## Overview

This project is a console-based Library Management System developed in Java. It allows librarians to manage books, patrons, lending operations, reservations, and notifications. The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and design patterns.

## Features

### Book Management

* Add books
* Remove books
* Update book details
* Search books by Title
* Search books by Author
* Search books by ISBN

### Patron Management

* Register patrons
* View patron details
* Track borrowing history

### Lending Management

* Checkout books
* Return books
* Track active loans

### Reservation System

* Reserve books that are currently borrowed
* Notify patrons when reserved books become available

---

## OOP Concepts Used

### Encapsulation

Book, Patron, and Loan classes use private fields with public methods for controlled access.

### Inheritance

Patron extends the abstract Person class.

### Abstraction

SearchStrategy and Observer interfaces define contracts for behavior.

### Polymorphism

Different search strategies are accessed through the SearchStrategy interface.

---

## Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

Used to support different search mechanisms:

* TitleSearchStrategy
* AuthorSearchStrategy
* IsbnSearchStrategy

### Observer Pattern

Used to implement the reservation notification system.

* Book acts as the Subject
* Patron acts as the Observer

### Factory Pattern

SearchFactory is used to create the appropriate search strategy.
